# Patient-Profiles

Patient profiles are often used to monitor the conduct of a clinical trial, detect safety signals, identify data entry errors, and catch protocol deviations. Each profile combines key data collected regarding a single subject â€“ everything from dosing to adverse events to lab results. This example shows how to leverage the SAS Macro Language, Output Delivery System (ODS), the REPORT procedure, and ODS Statistical Graphics to blend both tabular and graphical elements. The result is beautiful, highly-customized, information-rich patient profiles that meet the requirements for managing a modern clinical trial.
